The language of yani sayo is intended to explore how simplified the Adinjo language can become, and starts from the base of the officially endorsed language, Xoltwatax or Journalist. It is inspired by the language toki pona, and borrows some of its particles from that language.

## Spelling & Pronunciation 
Yani sayo has only 15 sounds and the same number of letters. These can be written in Adinjo script or the Latin script used by English speakers, and require no diacritics or special marks. Every letter is pronounced one way, with only a few exceptions that have their own clear rules as well.

+ **Consonants in Yani sayo**
	+ k, l, m, n, p, s, t, x, w, y

All of these consonants are pronounced as in Adinjo or English, with the exception of \<x> which is not a sound normally used in English words, but is used in some expressions like the Scottish word *loch* /lɔx/ meaning a lake, or "yech" /jɛx/ which is used to express distaste, disgust, and a feeling of grossness. 

In addition to this, in either script you may use the letter \<h> instead of \<x>, and in Latin script only, you may use the letter \<j> instead of \<y>. You should try your best to be consistent with these choices within a text.

+ **Vowels in Yani sayo**
	+ a, e, i, o, u

These vowels are pronounced more closely to how they are pronounced in Spanish or Japanese than they are to strict Adinjo or English pronunciations. It is important to note that all of these vowels are strictly **monopthongs**, and none of them have an inherent off-glide as some English vowels do. We are offering our best approximation of the vowels as they are used in English

- **a** sounds like the “a” in the word “car” or (in some dialects of English) the “o” in “pot,” or the “a” in “bath.”
- **e** sounds like the “a” in the word “bate,” though it has a sharper closure without an off-glide.
- **i** sounds like the “ee” in the word “fee,” but it does not have an off-glide like the English sound does when another letter follows it.
- **o** sounds like the “o” in the word “phone.”
- **u** sounds like the “oo” in “coo” or “moon,” or the “ou” in “you.”

> [!NOTE] International Phonetic Alphabet
> The *International Phonetic Alphabet*, or IPA, is a common way of showing how words and letters are pronounced. It is by design that the Latin spelling of Yani sayo reflects the IPA with the exception of preferring the letter \<y> to represent the IPA /j/ sound.

### Homophony
Because yani sayo has so few sounds and letters, each letter can be **realized** with a wider range than simply the English or Adinjo standard expectations. For example, the sounds of \<p>, \<t>, \<k> can be pronounced with or without aspiration, and with or without voicing. For example, the word ***pulik*** can also be pronounced as ***pulig, bulik,*** or ***bulig*** without changing in meaning.

This includes the vowels, even though they have strong prototypes listed above.

### Stress
Yani sayo has strict word-initial stress. This means that as you learn the sound of stressed syllables, you can easily tell where every word begins.
