## Lesson

We’ll start the basic sentence structure:

> *\[noun] li \[noun/adjective]*

This is the equivalent of the English structure

> *\[noun] is (a) \[noun/adjective]*

or the Adinjo Journalist structures

> *\[menachin] \[menachin/gormachin] ic*
> *\[menachin] an\[menachin/gormachin]*

For example:

> **Yani Sayo:** *xisi li tulot*
> **English:** (He/she/it/they) (is/are) (big/great/important).
> **Journalist:** (Ji/fi/xi) churito ic.

As this demonstrates, a single word in Yani Sayo may have multiple interpretations in a given sentence, and will be more clear based on the context in which a sentence is spoken or written. We can extend this even further, as some words in Yani Sayo have much broader domains of meaning than others:

> **Yani Sayo:** *papi li sayo*
> **English:** (Fruits/vegetables/mushrooms) are (good/tasty)
> **Journalist:** (Pavatu/sedjimu/vadrimnu) (sayomin) ic.

In this case, it is fairly obvious that “*sayo*” is used to reflect the positive quality or goodness of “*papi*”.

It doesn’t matter what sentence you are forming, in Yani Sayo you must always use “*li*” to mark the end of your subject and start of your predicate – unlike some other languages, there is no exception to this rule for any pronouns, and a sentence cannot be complete without “*li*” or another particle which is allowed to fill the same role.

This means it is very different to say:

> **Yani Sayo:** *yi sayo*
> **English:** My goodness
> **Journalist:** Kuyi sayoma.

as opposed to:

> **Yani Sayo:** *yi li sayo*
> **English:** I’m good, I’m okay
> **Journalist:** Yi zamur ic.

Now that we’ve covered this, try translating the following sentences into Yani Sayo:

> [!question]- **1.** Animals are important. | Zoanu frelmagic.
> *telwin li tulot*

> [!question]- **2.** He is little. | Ji dun ic.
> *xisi li motli*

> [!question]- **3.** I am great. | Yi curito ic.
> *yi li tulot*

> [!question]- **4.** It is a dog. | Xi kita ic.
> *xisi li telwan*

> [!question]- **5.** You are bad. | Ci walu ic.
> *ti li walo*
