The first lesson you should learn about Yani sayo is that this is not meant to be a language that gives fancy words for every possible idea. This is a minimalist language and is designed to have simple rules, and so it has a small number of words which offer a rich set of inflections to serve different roles in a sentence, along with short, simple particles which can provide additional marking.

The final vowel in Yani sayo words identifies the part of speech a word is filling. Words which have the letter \<a> or \<i> in their last syllable are nouns, specifically they fill the *accusative* and *nominative* roles of a sentence, respectively. Words which have \<o> in their last syllable are *descriptors* or *modifiers*, or as English speakers may be used to calling them, *adjectives* and *adverbs*.

The simplest expressive sentences in Yani Sayo imply their verbs and so only require a nominative element, the particle ***li***, and an accusative or descriptor. Here are the words for this first lesson:
