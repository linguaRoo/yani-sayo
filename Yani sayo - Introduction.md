Yani sayo is a novel exploration of the Adin language (specifically the formal "Journalist" language) which is simplified for learners and those curious about the idea of minimalism in language. Yani sayo is a simple language where every letter written is pronounced, and where there are only 15 formally defined sounds.

## Design Philosophy

Yani sayo is a language which seeks to simplify all of the rules of Adinjo Journalist by simplifying the sounds used, the structure of syllables, and the complicated rules of inflection and conjugation. It also adds a simple role marking system on top of phrasal particles, which helps to reduce ambiguity in structure, as there is plenty of ambiguity in semantic meaning due to the highly limited vocabulary.

As a language intended to be partially used in transitional learning of Adinjo Journalist, the language also has three grades of vocabulary, though this first book focuses specifically on Grade 1 vocabulary, the 144 words which allow one to express any concept in yani sayo.

## Phonology & Alphabet

Yani sayo uses only 15 letters when written, and each letter is formally pronounced in one way, though the small number of letters and sounds allows some flexibility in how each is pronounced so long as clarity is preserved. Here is the list of **consonants** used in yani sayo to start with:

| Manner         | Labial | Coronal | Velar |
| -------------- | ------ | ------- | ----- |
| **Stop**       | p      | t       | k     |
| **Nasal**      | m      | n       |       |
| **Fricative**  |        | s       | x     |
| **Other**      |        | l       |       |
| **Semi-Vowel** |        | y       | w     |

Each of these letters is pronounced as an Adin speaker would expect, or as an English speaker would expect with the exception of the \<x> letter, which is pronounced by raising the tongue to the ceiling of the mouth or "velum" and letting the airflow narrow between the tongue and ceiling of the mouth.

Next, we look at the vowels:

|           | Front | Back |
| --------- | ----- | ---- |
| **Close** | i     | u    |
| **Mid**   | e     | o    |
| **Open**  | a     |      |

Much like the consonants, these are pronounced as an Adin speaker would expect, with no *asènt* distinctions. Stressed syllables may be pronounced slightly longer and more clearly or tense, while unstressed vowels may be slightly shorter or lax -- but they should never overlap with the other sounds.

### Allophones

Because yani sayo does not distinguish the qualities of aspiration or voicing (or many others), any sound "close" to the sounds listed above may be used for them -- for example, you may use the /h/ sound instead of /x/ as long as you are clear, or a /f/ instead of /p/. As long as you don't use the same *realization* for several underlying sounds, you can even use different realizations in speech.

### Allographs

There are two officially permitted allographs which may be used:

- You may write \<**x**> as \<**h**>, primarily for the sake of English speakers. As these two characters are allophonic in yani sayo, there should be no confusion even if you mix and match these.
- You may write \<**y**> as \<**j**>, which reflects the IPA form of this sound. As there is no /**ʒ**/ sound in yani sayo, this allowance is made for non-Adinjo speakers who may be more familiar with \<j> as /j/.

### Rare & Unallowed Combinations
The following combinations are rare or unallowed in yani sayo.

> [!NOTE] The First Rule
> While the rules below are officially recognized, you may see official words which violate these rules. If there is a conflict between the official materials (the *tuwali yansi*) series, and these rules, the official materials take precedence, with later *towa* superseding earlier.

- <**yi**> is a rare combination unless it is at the start of a word. This is because it can be difficult to distinguish this combination when it is unstressed, especially after the close front vowels /e/ and /i/.
- <**wu**> is a rare combination unless it is at the start of a word. The reasoning is similar to that for <**yi**> given above, especially after the back vowels /o/ and /u/.
- Geminate consonants are disallowed within a word. While they *may* occur as an allophonic realization, they are not phonemic.
- The nasals may only collide across syllable boundaries as /m+n/ and not in any other order. This is rare, but is permitted as the sound is considered an iconic element of the Adin languages.

### Liquid Dissimilation

When they are not at the front of a word, \<yi> and \<wu> syllables will often adopt an alternate form through a rule called **dissimilation** -- the consonant will change to another consonant in order to be more clearly understood. In particular, \<yi> syllables tend to become \<li> syllables, and \<wu> syllables become \<xu> syllables. Note that only the initial consonant changes for these, coda consonants do not, and these changes are practical.

Because of this rule, it is my intention to avoid minimal pairs where \<yi> and \<li> would distinguish words, as well as where \<wu> and \<xu> would distinguish words.
